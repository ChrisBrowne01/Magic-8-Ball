We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

- Yes - definitely
- It is decidedly so
- Without a doubt
- Reply hazy, try again
- Ask again later
- Better not tell you now
- My sources say no
- Outlook not so good
- Very doubtful
- Most definately not
- All signs point to no
- Error
The output of the program will have the following format:

      [Name] asks: [Question]
      Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
      
For example:

      Christina asks: Will it rain today?
      Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now
